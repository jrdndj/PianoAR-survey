% this abstract might not make any sense anymore 
     Learning and mastering the piano involves several years of practice and hardwork. Throughout the years, several works have been designed and developed to help novices learn, and help teachers teach the piano. In this paper, we look at the different novel approaches that have been created to in learning the piano with the use of Augmented Reality. We put specific focus on breakthrough innovations on giving feedback, correcting learner mistakes and helping finger positioning. We intend to inquire on technologies needed that bridge novices closer into becoming experts. We also discuss possible takeaways and future steps towards pushing the said domain further.
